Portfolio page with Bootstrap
In this repo I am adding Bootstrap elements into my intial Portfolio Page design. I attached the CDN link for Bootstrap in the <head> tag. The goal of using Bootstrap for this particular assignment is to create a navbar, create a responsive layout as well as responsive images.
  
  In addition to the above I am attempting to utilize Bootstrap's grid system to create containers, rows and columns that will help with the responsiveness. THe ultimate goal is to make it functional on any size device. Enjoy and wish me luck! See the below screen grabs as well!
